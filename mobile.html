<i> Director / Cinematographer</i>

"The extent to which I consider myself an artist has constantly eluded me, for it's only been recently that I even adopted the title with all the preconception that goes along with it. I have regarded myself as an explorer, a naturalist, a minimalist, a humanist, but never as an artist.
<br><br>
My passion lies in telling stories, in sharing ideas, and seeking knowledge, all which is done through the cinematic medium. In layman's terms I choose not to be looking through the camera to see the world but, rather, be a man of the world who holds the camera. The full spectrum of human experience lies within the realm of capturing and, especially, in the realm of sharing. 
<br><br>
The intention is to follow in the footsteps of immortal minds, examine their discoveries, and create a visual illustration of what can only be called The Life Experience"</h3>

            <h3>This story is not one story. It is an illustration of many stories from friends and acquaintances who share a common experience. Being the spokesperson of such sensitive and heavy moments that existed in many of our lives, this film proved to be a great creative burden for myself.

Overcoming a tedious script, a tight time schedule, and logistical setbacks took dividents out of my both physically and emotionally and yet it remains to be one of my favorite pieces. I have nothing but gratitude for all of our tireless work and I pray that you find something for yourself in this little piece of work just as every one of us have.</h3>

        <h1>Home</h1>
            <h3>After realizing the full extent of the resources necessary to accomplish this film in preproduction, we were very close to shutting the project down and postponing it for a later time. However, when an untimely tragedy occured to my closest friend, it served as a reminder that sometimes these pieces need to be made not for ourselves but for those that it may affect the most. The incident launched me back full force into production, and I could not have been more greatful that it did.

<br>
The tight time crunch inspired my entire production team to the furthest reaches of their creative potential creating, what I believe to be, one of our greatest pieces yet. "Home" a short film that experiments with the idea of life and death, also experiments with ideas of shadows and light, of sound and silence, taking contrasting elements and combining them to create a surreal adventure of visual stimulus.
